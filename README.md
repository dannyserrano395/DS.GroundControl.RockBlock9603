The RockBlock9603 project is a C# library, CLI, and test suite for the Iridium RockBLOCK 9603 satellite modem. It handles AT commands over serial communication, supporting text and binary SBD messaging, device queries, and unsolicited responses. I built it as a portfolio project to showcase my engineering skills.
